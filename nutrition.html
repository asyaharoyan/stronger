          <h3>Are Humans Supposed to Eat Meat?</h3>
          <p>
            People who eat meat argue that it’s “natural” for humans to consume
            animals. But is this true or just an excuse to ignore the horrific
            ways in which animals are killed for food? Are we really supposed to
            eat meat?
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>We Don’t Have Carnivorous Teeth</h3>

          <p>
            Humans have short, soft fingernails and small, dull canine teeth.
            All true carnivores have sharp claws and large canine teeth that are
            capable of tearing flesh without the help of knives and forks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Richard Leakey, a renowned anthropologist, says, “You can’t tear
            flesh by hand, you can’t tear hide by hand. Our anterior teeth are
            not suited for tearing flesh or hide. We don’t … have large canine
            teeth, and we wouldn’t have been able to deal with food sources that
            required those large canines.”
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Our Digestive System Doesn’t Like Meat</h3>
          <p>
            Carnivores have short intestinal tracts that allow meat to pass
            quickly through their digestive system. Humans’ intestinal tracts
            are much longer, like those of plant-eaters. This gives the body
            more time to break down fiber and absorb the nutrients from
            plant-based foods.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Meat Can Cause Heart Disease in Humans</h3>
          <p>
            Carnivorous animals in the wild virtually NEVER develop heart
            disease or suffer from strokes—ailments that humans can suffer an
            increased risk of developing due to their consumption of the
            saturated fat and cholesterol found in meat. Heart disease is the
            number one killer in the U.S., according to the American Heart
            Association. If humans were meant to eat meat, why do meat-eaters
            have a 32 percent higher risk of developing heart disease than
            vegetarians?
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Numerous studies have shown that meat is not ideal for the human
            body and may actually be making us sick and killing us. The human
            body is intended to function on plant-based foods that are full of
            fiber, antioxidants, unsaturated fat, essential fatty acids,
            phytochemicals, and cholesterol-free protein.
