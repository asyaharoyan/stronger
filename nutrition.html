          <p>
            Gladiatorial combat and training were very high-energy activities
            that required a lot of calories. The high-carb diets would provide
            quick fuel and were cheap to buy. Gladiators were mostly
            vegetarians, but not because of any moral restraints against killing
            animals. They were vegetarians because they believed the vegetarian
            diet will increase their effectiveness in duels. Gladiators are
            proof that a high-protein diet is not always required diet for
            athletes. You can be a great athlete even if you are a vegetarian.

        <article>
          <p>
            As we already know whole-food plant-based proteins usually contain
            fiber, but they also come with a number of other health benefits.
            Plant-based proteins contain a wide array of vitamins, minerals, and
            antioxidants while animal proteins tend to be higher in fat and
            cholesterol.

        <h2>Humans diet</h2>
        <article>
          <div class="container">
            <h3>Are Humans Supposed to Eat Meat?</h3>
            <p>
              People who eat meat argue that it’s “natural” for humans to
              consume animals. But is this true or just an excuse to ignore the
              horrific ways in which animals are killed for food? Are we really
              supposed to eat meat?
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>We Don’t Have Carnivorous Teeth</h3>

            <p>
              Humans have short, soft fingernails and small, dull canine teeth.
              All true carnivores have sharp claws and large canine teeth that
              are capable of tearing flesh without the help of knives and forks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Richard Leakey, a renowned anthropologist, says, “You can’t
              tear flesh by hand, you can’t tear hide by hand. Our anterior
              teeth are not suited for tearing flesh or hide. We don’t … have
              large canine teeth, and we wouldn’t have been able to deal with
              food sources that required those large canines.”
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Our Digestive System Doesn’t Like Meat</h3>
            <p>
              Carnivores have short intestinal tracts that allow meat to pass
              quickly through their digestive system. Humans’ intestinal tracts
              are much longer, like those of plant-eaters. This gives the body
              more time to break down fiber and absorb the nutrients from
              plant-based foods.
            </p>
          </div>
          <br />
          <div class="container">
            <h3>Meat Can Cause Heart Disease in Humans</h3>
            <p>
              Carnivorous animals in the wild virtually NEVER develop heart
              disease or suffer from strokes—ailments that humans can suffer an
              increased risk of developing due to their consumption of the
              saturated fat and cholesterol found in meat. Heart disease is the
              number one killer in the U.S., according to the American Heart
              Association. If humans were meant to eat meat, why do meat-eaters
              have a 32 percent higher risk of developing heart disease than
              vegetarians?
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Numerous studies have shown that meat is not ideal for the human
              body and may actually be making us sick and killing us. The human
              body is intended to function on plant-based foods that are full of
              fiber, antioxidants, unsaturated fat, essential fatty acids,
              phytochemicals, and cholesterol-free protein.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Dietary Factors</h3>
            <p>
              The Western diet is notorious for including a lot of high-fat
              meat, which can contribute to heart disease, obesity, cancer and
              breakouts. Research shows eating higher-fat meat may increase
              hormones that stimulate production of more sebaceous follicles,
              which can block pores and cause acne.
